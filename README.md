# Modelling social and solitary foraging behaviour of *C. elegans*

## Project description
This repository provides both code and data for the minimal and strain-specific model used in *Benefits of collective feeding in patchy food environments tested with C. elegans*. The minimal model is developed to compare social and solitary feeding strategies which only differ in the ability of worms to form groups on food in environments with different degrees of food clustering.
